/**
 * Replace `currentPath` with `newPath` atomically. Strategy depends on OS:
 *
 * - **Linux / macOS**: POSIX rename(2) does an inode swap, not a write,
 *   so swapping the directory entry while the binary is executing is
 *   safe. The running process holds the old inode; subsequent execs pick
 *   up the new one. ETXTBSY only fires on attempts to *write to* the
 *   running binary, which we never do.
 *
 * - **Windows**: cannot rename or delete a running .exe (the OS holds an
 *   exclusive lock). Strategy used by `bun upgrade` and `deno upgrade`:
 *   rename `kimchi.exe` → `kimchi.exe.old`, drop the new binary in as
 *   `kimchi.exe`, leave the .old behind for the next launch to clean up.
 *   We can't delete the old in this run because we're still it.
 *
 * Optionally backs up the old binary to ~/.cache/kimchi/backups/ before
 * the swap so a corrupt new version can be rolled back manually.
